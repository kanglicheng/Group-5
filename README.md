## Group Projects: Alpha Class

To help you continue learning and gaining valuable experience we’ve decided to test out **optional group projects**, where you can work together on something bigger than you may normally in class.

These projects will help you reinforce principles learned in class like OOD, and scalability, as well as learn new domain specific skills and hone existing ones (frontend, backend, data science, mobile etc.). It will also allow you to practice agile development and SCRUM, as well as all the challenges that go with working on group projects (merge conflicts, rebasing, testing, managing different coding styles...).

This test period will initially last about 4 weeks, where we will have weekly check-ins with instructors to keep track of progress, offer support, and provide guidance.

You shouldn’t feel too much additional pressure from signing up to this and it shouldn’t detract from your other responsibilities and commitments, like applying to jobs, taking interviews or reverse recruiting. That said, the people you will be most accountable to are yourselves and your teammates, so make sure to only make time commitments that you feel comfortable making, but follow through on those commitments.

If this trial period is successful it will provide a template for future classes and existing alumni to participate in, and could also pave the way for larger group projects or even open source projects that could build the tools future classes and alumni will use in their own job search!

But despite the potential significance of these projects, at the end of the day we do want this to be enjoyable because that’s the best way to learn anything. Be creative and try out new technologies or tools you haven’t tried before. Move fast and break things. Be open to each other’s ideas and learning from people with different backgrounds and experience.

And in the words of the great John Hammond:
*“Creation is an act of sheer will.“*
